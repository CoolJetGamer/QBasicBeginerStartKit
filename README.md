# QBasicBeginerStartKit
A guide on learning QBasic along with the programs mentioned.
If you want to use the guide, do not look at the sample programs until you are done with the guide.

# How to use these GNU-GPL licenced sample programs
You can follow the guide.
But the guide only shows how to do the programming part.
You need QBasic, but QBasic is a 16-Bit MS-DOS application. It does not run on Windows 10 without emulation which tends to slow down the application. You can use QBasic in DosBox or you can use QB64. I used QB64 as it runs on Windows 10 natively and has extra commands while being fully compatible with QBasic.
